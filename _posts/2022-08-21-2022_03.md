## Executive Summary

By creating a Play-to-earn system with smart contracts which links to an app also known as Happy Walking, it encourages people to engage in physical activity by providing incentives to those who lead an active lifestyle. It also encourages people to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The incentive will be in the form of our native fungible token (WALK).
For the game-fi elements, users will equip themselves with NFTs in the form of shoes and by walking or jogging for some distance, they can earn WALK as the reward, which can be used for other NFT shoes or converted to ETH and cashed out for profit.

For the social-fi elements, users will be able to connect with their friends and they could get extra rewards if they walk or jog together. This aims to encourage more interaction between users.

### Background

Smart contracts are computer programs that act as agreements where the terms of the agreement can be programmed with the ability to self-execute. The main characteristics of smart contracts include immutability, security and transparency.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are forced to stay at home more often, and it is uncomfortable to do exercise with a mask on, as a result, most people are doing less exercise, not even walking to school or office. However, it is always important to have a habit of exercising, so as to achieve a healthy lifestyle, improve muscle strength and boost endurance.

According to the World Health Organization, the global obesity rate has almost tripled since 1975. In 2016, 39% of adults above 18 years old were overweight. Being overweight or obese can have detrimental effects on oneâ€™s health. It increases risk of several diseases which include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, etc. Such a phenomenon is preventable to a great extent.

We noticed the urgent need to encourage people to do more exercise everyday, so that our society will become healthier. One way to prevent overweight and obesity among people is to consistently engage in physical activity. Other than preventing overweight and obesity, exercising regularly can also help to boost memory and thinking skills. To encourage healthy lifestyle among people, we are building a smart contract system to provide rewards to those who stay active.

Besides, NFT is becoming more and more popular and is now under the spotlight. Having seen a variety of different interesting projects on play to earn, we are also interested in developing our own project on promoting healthy lifestyle. We believe that our walk to earn system has a large potential as people can earn via walking, in which walking is what people often do in their days. This project will also be attractive to companies in the sports industry, which helps to create a sustainable business model.
