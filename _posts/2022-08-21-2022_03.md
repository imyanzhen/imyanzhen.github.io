## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the launch of an innovative application, Happy Walking, which utilizes a play-to-earn system built on smart contracts to promote physical activity. Participants will be rewarded with a proprietary token, WALK, for leading an active lifestyle. As users engage in walking or jogging, they can accrue WALK tokens through NFTs, represented as virtual shoes. These tokens can be exchanged for other NFT items or converted to Ethereum (ETH), offering a tangible financial incentive.

Furthermore, the platform incorporates a social dimension, encouraging users to connect and exercise with friends for additional rewards. This social aspect is designed to foster community and enhance user interaction within the app.

### Background

Smart contracts, known for their immutable, secure, and transparent nature, are the backbone of this system. With the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to a sedentary lifestyle due to increased indoor confinement and discomfort associated with exercising in masks, there is a pressing need to motivate regular physical activity.

The World Health Organization has noted a significant rise in obesity rates, a preventable condition linked to several serious health issues. Our system aims to counter this by incentivizing daily exercise, leveraging the burgeoning popularity of NFTs. This endeavor not only supports individual health but presents an attractive venture for the sports industry, laying the groundwork for a viable business model.

The application’s dual focus on health and earnings through NFTs, particularly in the context of walking—a universally accessible activity—holds the potential to resonate widely. We anticipate that this innovative blend of technology and wellness will propel us towards a healthier society.
