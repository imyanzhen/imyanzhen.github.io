## Executive Summary
With the immense growth of the internet, we can easily acquire information and have more
freedom to express thoughts online. However, freedom of speech in social media or online
forums can be risky and problematic as not every post or comment has positive connotations.
There is a growing number of aggressive, insulting and misleading comments and these have
affected online users in multiple aspects. These could impact the social well-being of the
community, as well as economic impact on businesses and the platforms themselves. Therefore,
we have come up with a blockchain smart contract solution that is able to eliminate these
“irresponsible and hateful” comments. We also have deployed our solution in Solidity as a proof
that our solution is replicable and scalable. This concept can be further developed and
implemented throughout all social media platforms and online forums to regulate users’
behaviours in the comment sections.
### Background and Motivation
In 2014, a Pew Research Center study found that about one-in-five (22%) internet users that had
been victims of online harassment reported that it had happened in the comment section of a
website. People become more militant and unaware of the consequences when posting online
compared to in-person communication, and users’ anonymity is one of the causes of this. Option
to post as anonymous makes irresponsible users feel ‘safe’ and ‘untraceable’, hence they do not
have much consideration before posting something harmful, vitriolic, misleading or hurtful to
people ( also known as Online Disinhibition Effect ). Businesses are also impacted by this.
There are no restrictions, hence competitors can post hateful comments without any hesitations,
and with anonymity, they can simply edit or delete to remove the proof. On the other hand, the
company itself can also post fake reviews on their own page to enhance their products’
credibility. Therefore, a solution that can control the transparency of the platform(s) has to be
implemented and certain guidelines with consequences have to be imposed for the irresponsible
parties.
### Existing Solution and Why It Is Not Effective
Social media and forums generally prevent hateful speech by forbidding anonymous comments
that trigger discrimination, hatred, or violence. These internet intermediaries develop definitions
of hate speech and take active measures by using automated filters to censor foul language and
algorithms to flag similar content. Forum administrators make final decisions on whether to
remove the flagged comments and ban the users who violate the terms of use. Platforms also
play a passive role by relying on users to report inappropriate contents. However, there are
limitations to existing solutions. The algorithms for censorship are only able to detect hate
speech in a few languages. Those who speak minority languages are left unprotected. Even if
more resources are input to improve the algorithms, the existing dataset is not large enough to
train artificial intelligence. Moreover, the efficiency of administrators manually processing such
an enormous volume of data is low. Pervasive contents may remain online for months for
unpopular languages before it is removed (Time, 2019).
Description of Procedure and Results In order to tackle this issue, we would like to propose an
idea using blockchain smart contracts. Smart contracts are immutable, irreversible and secured,
hence once the comments have been posted, users are not able to amend or delete their
comments. By using smart contracts, we can regulate the whole comment section. Firstly, upon
successful registration and account verification (not a duplicated/fake account), users will receive
initial community coins to be able to vote and post comments.. And only registered users are able
to post comments in the forum. Then, users will have to deposit some coins in order to post
comments or vote. As blockchain smart contracts are a distributed and decentralized ledger, we
want to utilize voting (thumbs up and down) to determine whether the comment is appropriate
or not. For the comments to be judgeable, the amount of thumbs up/down have to be 3x larger
than the other (Proof of Authority from the users in the community). If a user posts an
irresponsible comment, his/her stake or coin will be evenly distributed to the majority votes.
However, the user will receive coins as rewards if they post comments responsibly. The cutoff
time to execute is after 5000 blocks. Each of the user’s accounts will be associated with a phone
number and other information, hence once a user runs out of coins, he/she will not be able to
generate a new or “fake” account, and is prohibited from commenting on the platform forever.
The group of miners in the blockchain act as moderators to determine whether the comments
should be kept or removed by proof of authority. Decisions are made more transparently as all
are recorded in blocks that anyone has access to; judgements are also more fair considering they
are group decisions made by decentralized miners.
