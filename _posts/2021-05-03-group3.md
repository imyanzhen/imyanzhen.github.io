##Executive Summary
The proliferation of the internet has ushered in a new era where information is readily accessible and freedom of expression flourishes online. However, this liberty is often marred by the prevalence of aggressive and misleading commentary, which can negatively impact social welfare and economic interests. To address this, we propose a blockchain smart contract system designed to mitigate "irresponsible and hateful" comments. Our solution, demonstrated through a Solidity deployment, is both replicable and scalable, with potential for widespread application across social media platforms and forums to moderate user interaction in comment sections effectively.

###Background and Rationale
A 2014 study by Pew Research Center revealed that a significant portion of online harassment occurred within website comment sections. The anonymity afforded by the internet emboldens users, resulting in a phenomenon known as the Online Disinhibition Effect, where harmful or deceptive content is posted without forethought to the repercussions. The impact extends to businesses, where unrestricted posting allows for unfounded negative commentary or deceitful positive reviews. A transparent and accountable system is imperative to foster responsible online communication.

###Analysis of Current Measures
Current measures against online harassment typically involve censoring anonymity and automated filtering of offensive language, supplemented by user reports. Forum administrators then adjudicate on the flagged content. Despite these efforts, the limitations are stark, particularly for languages with fewer speakers, where hateful content persists longer due to the insufficiency of resources to refine censorship algorithms or datasets for AI training. The manual oversight by administrators is also overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content.

###Proposal and Implications
We propose leveraging the immutable and secure nature of blockchain smart contracts to regulate online comments. Upon verified registration, users receive initial coins for posting and voting on comments. To maintain accountability, posting requires a coin deposit, and community voting—rooted in a 'Proof of Authority' model—determines the appropriateness of comments. Irresponsible posts result in a forfeiture of coins, redistributed to responsible users. This system, linked to verifiable user information, prevents the creation of duplicate accounts, enforcing a lifetime ban on commenting for depleted coin balances. Miners, serving as community moderators, further ensure transparency and fairness in content judgement, with all decisions recorded on the blockchain.
