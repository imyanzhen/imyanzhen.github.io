## Executive Summary
Asset transfer and trust funds charge a high transaction fee and take a long time for the
contract to process in the real world. These barriers deter the transferring of assets and create
inconvenience for users. Smart contract, as a well acknowledged digital technology which
runs the terms of an agreement automatically, makes the asset transfer more effective using
tokenization. With tokenization, the entry barrier can be reduced and the intermediaries can
be eliminated. Therefore, we have designed a smart contract for asset transfer under partition
of inheritance.
