I am  a Tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management at HKUST](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the future of labor markets, FinTech, health IT and statistical learning. My studies have been published in MIS Quarterly, POM and featured by Bloomberg Businessweek. I have been invited to present her work to the Federal Reserve Bank at Philadelphia and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Department of Treasury. I also have methodological work published in premier journals of statistics, such as Biometrika.


I also [teach classes]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/) in FinTech and cryptoventures and introcution to MIS for several different groups of students at HKUST.


My  research interests  include:
- High-dimensional statistics
- Nonparametric  statistics
- Change point detection
- Causal inference
- Quantile regression 
- Bayesian and empirical bayes methodology
- Graphical models
