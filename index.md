I'm currently an associate professor in the Information Systems, Business Statistics, and Operations Management department at HKUST. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie in the future of labor markets, FinTech, health IT, and statistical learning. My work has been published in journals such as MIS Quarterly, ISR, and POM, and has also been highlighted by Bloomberg Businessweek and CNBC Professional. I've had the opportunity to present my research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Department of Treasury. Additionally, I have contributed methodological work to leading journals in machine learning and statistics, including Biometrika and JMLR. For the trivia lovers out there, I've somehow ended up with an Erdős number of 3.

I also [teach classes]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/) in Blockchain, FinTech and cryptoventures for MBA, MSc and BBA students at HKUST.

### If you're an undergrad or grad student at HKUST, I'm also hiring for part-time/full-time RA work. Shoot me an email if you're interested!

My  research interests  include:
- Digital Technologies and Social Justice
- FinTech 
- Blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0
- Algo-trading
- Smart Healthcare
- Causal inference
- Quantile regression and empirical bayes methodology
- Graphical models
